===================
External components
===================

Parts of eCAL have a different license than the main project.
These components may either be shipped with the repository as source code, or along with / included in the eCAL binaries.
The information in this list may not be exhaustive.
Some dependencies, like GoogleTest, are not used in our officially distributed builds, even though they can be used with eCAL and therefore appear in this list.
