Installing eCAL
===============

Before using eCAL, you must install it on your PC.
This section covers how to install eCAL on Microsoft Windows and Ubuntu (both 64 bit only).
You can either use eCAL just on one PC (local communication) or on multiple PCs (cloud communication).
We will cover both scenarios in the next sections.

So, let's get started!

   If you are looking for a tutorial on how to build eCAL from source (e.g. to get it working on a non-supported OS) please refer to :ref:`development_building_ecal_from_source` .

|fa-ubuntu| Installing eCAL on Ubuntu
=====================================

For Ubuntu, you can either install eCAL from a PPA (Personal Package Archive) or manually from debian files.
For most users, the PPA will provide the easiest way of installing eCAL.
The PPA also supports more Ubuntu Versions and CPU Architectures (x86, x64, arm64, armhf).

**Ubuntu 22.04 Users**:
You may experience issues with the GUI Applications (actually all Qt5 Apps) due to Ubuntus switch to wayland.
But you can :ref:`log in with X11 <faq_ubuntu_22_04_graphical_issues>`, which solves those issues.

   Advanced users can also :ref:`compile eCAL from source <development_building_ecal_from_source>`.

|fa-ubuntu| Automatically install eCAL from a PPA
-------------------------------------------------

Installing eCAL from a PPA will cause apt-get to automatically update eCAL for you.
You can choose from different PPAs, depending on your desired upgrade path.
