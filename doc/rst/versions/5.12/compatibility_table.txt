.. list-table:: eCAL 5.12 vs. 5.11
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Wire compatibility
     
     - * **eCAL UDP**: 100% compatible in default settings

         A proper Topic-Name -> UDP-Multicast-Group computation has been added.
         By default, the old version (``multicast_config_version = v1``) is enabled in the :file:`ecal.yaml`, which makes the UDP Layer 100% compatible.
         If the new version (``v2``) is enabled, UDP communication between eCAL 5.12 and older versions of eCAL will fail.
  
       * **eCAL TCP**: 100% compatible

       * **Services**: 100% compatible

       * **eCAL Shared Memory**: 100% compatible

       * **eCAL Registration Layer**: 100% compatible

         New fields have been added in the internal protobuf format.

   * - API / ABI

     - * **API**: downwards compatible.
         
       * **ABI**: not compatible

         From now on, the official eCAL installer for Windows is built with Visual Studio 2019 / v142.
         This means, that you need VS 2019 or newer to link against the included SDK.

   * - Tools

     - * **Rec**: Downwards compatible
         
         The ``SetConfig`` RPC Call has been added, which was not available in eCAL 5.11

       * **Sys**: 100% compatible

       * **Measurements**: 100% compatible

       * **Meas Cutter**: The structure of the output directory has changed.
         It is now aligned to the output structure of eCAL Rec.
