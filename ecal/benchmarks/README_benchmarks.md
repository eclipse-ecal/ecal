# eCAL Benchmarks - Overview

This folder contains the benchmarks used in the performance tracking of eCAL (see GitHub workflows). The benchmarks use the Google Benchmark framework. Each sub-folder (except util) contains a source file and another Readme explaining the details of the benchmark(s) implemented in the source file.

# Build

- When building eCAL, the `-DECAL_THIRDPARTY_BUILD_BENCHMARK` and `-DECAL_BUILD_BENCHMARKS` options must be set to `ON`.
- Each sub-folder (except util) produces an independent executable with the benchmark(s) of the included source file when built.
