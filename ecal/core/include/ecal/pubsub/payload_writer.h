   * @brief Base payload writer class to allow zero copy memory operations.
   *
   * This class serves as the base class for payload writers, allowing zero-copy memory
   * operations. The `WriteFull` and `WriteModified` calls may operate on the target
   * memory file directly in zero-copy mode.
   * 
   * A partial writing / modification of the memory file is only possible when zero-copy mode 
   * is activated. If zero-copy is not enabled, the `WriteModified` method is ignored and the 
   * `WriteFull` method is always executed (see CPublisher::ShmEnableZeroCopy)
