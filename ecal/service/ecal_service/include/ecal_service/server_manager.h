  /**
   * @brief Manager for ecal_service::server instances
   * 
   * The ServerManager keeps track of and manages all ecal_service::server
   * instances that it created. It is used to create and stop servers. The
   * user doesn't need to manage the servers manually, e.g. for stopping them
   * from a central place.
   * 
   * The ServerManager is only available as shared_ptr. It must be created
   * using the static create() method.
   *
   * - Upon creation, the ServerManager will create a work object for the
   *   given io_context. This will keep the io_context alive, even if there
   *   are no servers running.
   * 
   * - For creating a server, the create_server() method must be used. This
   *   will create a new server instance and return a shared_ptr to it.
   * 
   * - For stopping all servers, the stop() method must be used. This
   *   will stop all servers and delete the internal work object, so the
   *   thread executing it can be joined.
   * 
   * =========================================================================
   * _Important_: Do not stop the io_context. This may cause undefined
   *              behavior. Instead, stop the server manager and wait for the
   *              io_context to run out of work on its own.
   * =========================================================================
   * 
   * Example code:
   *
   * @code {.cpp}
   * 
   *   // Create a server manager
   *   auto server_manager = ecal_service::ServerManager::create(io_context);
   *  
   *   // Create and start an io_context thread.
   *   std::thread io_context_thread([&io_context]() { io_context->run(); });
   *  
   *   // Create actual server instances
   *   auto server1 = server_manager->create_server(...)
   *   auto server2 = server_manager->create_server(...)
   *   
   *   // DO STUFF
   * 
   *   // Stop ALL servers from a common place
   *   server_manager->stop();
   *      
   *   // Join the io_context thread. The io_context does not need to be stopped.
   *   io_context_thread.join();
   * 
   * @endcode
