Test Objective:
    Verify that a local UDP-based communication path remains functional even if a separate network UDP publisher is interruptedâ€”
    simulating a real-world scenario such as a cable unplug or network failure.

Test Context:
    This test validates the robustness of the eCAL UDP transport layer under fault conditions by checking that 
    local communication is not affected by failures in network-based communication.

Test Scenario:
    1. A local UDP publisher and subscriber run within the **same container** using eCAL's local mode.
       - The publisher sends payloads with value 42.
       - The subscriber listens on the same topic and tracks received message values.
       
    2. A second publisher (network UDP publisher) runs in a **separate container** using network mode.
       - It sends payloads with value 43.
       - This simulates a system component publishing over the network.

    3. Both publishers operate concurrently for 7 seconds to ensure simultaneous communication.

    4. After 7 seconds, the test **disconnects the network UDP publisher from the Docker network**, simulating a network cable being unplugged.

    5. The subscriber continues running and should:
       - Stop receiving value 43 (as the network publisher is gone).
       - Still receive value 42 from the local publisher.

Success Criteria:
    - The subscriber container exits cleanly (exit code 0).
    - The subscriber reports all messages with value 42 received **after** the network publisher is disconnected.
    - At least two messages with value 43 should appear before disconnection; this is required for pass.

Note:
    This test focuses on **functional separation between local and network communication** in eCAL.
    It is useful to validate system reliability when components fail independently.
