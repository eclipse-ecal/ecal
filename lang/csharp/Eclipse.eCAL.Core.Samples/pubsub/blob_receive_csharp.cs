/**
 * @file blob_receive.cs
 *
 * @brief A minimal example of using the eCAL API to receive messages.
 *
 * This example demonstrates how to initialize the eCAL API, print version information,
 * create a subscriber for the topic "blob" (using "std::string" as the data type), register
 * a receive callback to process incoming messages, and keep the application running until eCAL
 * is terminated. It serves as a basic reference for implementing a subscriber in C#.
