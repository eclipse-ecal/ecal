/**
 * @file blob_send.cs
 *
 * @brief A minimal example of using the eCAL API to send messages.
 *
 * This example demonstrates how to initialize the eCAL API, print version information,
 * create a publisher for the topic "blob" (using "std::string" as the data type), construct
 * and send messages, and keep the application running until eCAL is terminated. It serves as
 * a basic reference for implementing a publisher in C#.
