eCAL Performance Benchmarks
===========================

eCAL includes performance benchmarks based on the Google Benchmark framework.
To build them, set ``ECAL_THIRDPARTY_BUILD_BENCHMARK`` and ``ECAL_BUILD_BENCHMARKS`` to ``ON``.
The applications are named ``ecal_benchmark_<type>``.

The performance benchmarks are also executed automatically on GitHub runners for each commit on the master branch of the `GitHub repository <https://github.com/eclipse-ecal/ecal>`_.
These results can be found on `Bencher <https://bencher.dev/console/projects/ecal/plots>`_.

Currently, the benchmarks focus mostly on publisher-subscriber performance via shared memory.

.. note::
   The full name of a benchmark as it shows up in the results is ``<benchmark name>/<optional variants>/<optional benchmark configurations>``,
   e.g. ``BM_eCAL_Send/262144/real_time``, ``BM_eCAL_Multi_Send/8/4096/min_warmup_time:2.000/real_time`` or ``BM_eCAL_Ping``.

Performance regression analysis
-------------------------------

`Bencher <https://bencher.dev/console/projects/ecal/plots>`_ also scans for statistically significant performance regression in benchmark results via so-called `Thresholds <https://bencher.dev/docs/explanation/thresholds/>`_.
A threshold with a t-test for an alpha value of 0.5% is active on all benchmarks. The current limit can be seen by activating the upper boundary in the performance plot view.
So-called Alerts are generated should a result cross this limit, they are indicated via an icon in the performance plot.
