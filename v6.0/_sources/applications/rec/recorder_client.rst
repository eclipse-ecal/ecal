=====================================
|ecalrec_APP_ICON_h1| eCAL Rec Client
=====================================

The eCAL Rec Client is a command-line style application that gets remote controlled by an eCAL Rec Host Application (i.e. :ref:`applications_recorder_gui` or :ref:`applications_recorder_cli`).
Start this application on all machines that shall record topics in a distributed recording scenario.

.. note::
   Usually you will not need to manually control the eCAL Rec Client, as eCAL Rec CLI provides all the same features and more; it basically has a built-in eCAL Rec Client.
