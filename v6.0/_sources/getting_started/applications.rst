Applications
============

In the following sections we will look at the most important applications that ship with eCAL.

We will start with the **eCAL Monitor** that is mainly useful for debugging, as it lets you easily see what is going on in your eCAL network.

We then look at the **eCAL Recorder** and **eCAL Player**.
Those applications let you record and replay snapshots of eCAL traffic.


Last we check out **eCAL Sys**, which is an application to manage your (distributed) startup configurations and monitor your started eCAL Tasks.
