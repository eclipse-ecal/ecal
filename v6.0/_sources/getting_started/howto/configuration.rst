Runtime Configuration
=====================

In eCAL it is also possible to configure the environment at runtime.
The eCAL API provides a set of structures that reflect the yaml configuration file (:ref:`configuration_options`).

You can pass this configuration structure to ``eCAL::Initialize()``.

But there is more: You can also modifiy the configuration of each publisher and subscriber individually.
This allows you to be more flexible in the design of your application.

.. important::
    Once set and passed to ``eCAL::Initialize()``, the configuration is set.
    The getters for the configuration structures, e.g. ``eCAL::GetConfiguration()``, return a constant struct.
    So it is has no effect to modify the configuration object without passing it to ``eCAL::Initialize()``.

In our example we will create multiple publishers and subscribers. 
They will communicate on different layers and will not interfere with each other, besides the same topic name.
